## crop-weed-detection
# Introdution
Crop and weed detection is a deep learning-based solution for real-time crop and weed identification in agricultural fields. Using an object detection model like YOLOv8, the system can accurately distinguish crops from weeds based on image data. This technology is a part of precision agriculture aims to significantly reduce herbicide usage, lower operational costs, and lead to healthier crops and higher yields
# Key Features
Real-time detection of crops and weeds.
Built on the lightweight and fast YOLOv8 architecture.
High accuracy with a Mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 90.1%.
Adaptable to different crop and weed types, easily extendable for future crops.
# Technology Stack
Python for development.
YOLOv8 for object detection.
Other necessary libraries and tools for dataset handling and model training.
# Project Structure
Organized project files for dataset handling, training, and prediction.
Clear modular code to ease installation, usage, and future improvements.
# Setup & Installation
Clone the repository to your local system.
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Install all required dependencies specified in the project.
# Usage
Explore the dataset to understand the data distribution and labeling.
Train the YOLOv8 model on the annotated dataset.
Run predictions on new images to identify crops and weeds.
# Model Performance
